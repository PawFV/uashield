## How it works

Our voluntary defense center works are doing all the hard work: monitoring the targets, running the technical infrastructure, coordinating the attack targets, coordinating with the client applications, etc.
When the attack is performed, the application gets the data that it needs automatically.
The only thing you need to do is to install it.
Targets being attacked are changed automatically and are downloaded from the control center/server.
